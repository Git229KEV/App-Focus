Welcome to my rep Git229KEV
This app provides you from distraction - free environment from other apps while working/ attending meetings and more(Python + Tkinter GUI)
You may not be able to shift to other tabs(Alt + Tab keys combination)
You will also be able to set the number of seconds, for example if a meeting is there scheduled for 50 minutes, (alt + tab) will not work for that particular time. You can set the time in seconds
# Set focus for a fixed period (in seconds)
focus_time = 10  # Change this to your desired focus time -- you can find this function in the code
